Currently, I am a Software/Developer Engineer at Amazon.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [NSF Center for Big Learning](http://nsfcbl.org) at the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu), where I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I published papers on robotics and federated learning.

I am broadly interested in all aspects of deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning, robust and scalable intelligent systems, and its applications in robotics. I blog about these topics at <https://georgerpu.github.io/blog/> along with other computer science topics, mathematics (my first :heart:), and whatever else I find interesting that week.

In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports (mainly :basketball: and video games), trying new food, reading history and social science, and learning new subjects.
