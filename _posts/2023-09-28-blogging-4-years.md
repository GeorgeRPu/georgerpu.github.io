Four years ago, I published [my first blog post](https://georgerpu.github.io/blog/2019/the-cantor-set-minus-itself/). It was a simple proof that $C - C = [0, 1]$ where $C$ is the Cantor set. Since then I have published over a dozen posts about mostly mathematics and programming, but also the [book's I've read](https://georgerpu.github.io/blog/tag/reading/) and [economics](https://georgerpu.github.io/blog/2023/economic-possiblities-for-ourselves/). Blogging has been my most consistent[^1] side project or hobby in the past 4 years.

I started blogging because many of the AI researchers I looked up to had blogs. Blogging was a way to, dare I say, promote myself. Most of my early posts were related to the AI research I was doing while still an undergraduate. I switched from other themes to my current theme [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), designed for academics. I am not sure if this strategy ever worked. I still haven't setup any analytics to track blog viewership. Very quickly, my blog topics diversified. Blogging became an excuse to learn things well, as I would need to write about them. Blogging is also a way to publish my thoughts and opinions, not just factual information. I continue to blog for these reasons, but most of all, I blog because I find it fun.

I encourage anyone reading to consider blogging.

1. It's fun.
2. It can be as easy as you want. [It's a myth that blog posts need to be perfect works of art and science](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/06/05/some-blogging-myths/). Dispelling this myth, giving myself room for the subpar, had made blogging more enjoyable.
3. It's a good method to practice writing which is a critical skill for any white collar worker. Even if [you are a software engineer, you will need to master writing](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/).
4. You have a unique perspective which others may benefit from.

As for me, I have tried posting once every 2 months, 6 times a year, for the past 4 years. The schedule has helped me be prolific at the cost of laborious nights finishing a piece I have lost interest in. Going forward, I don't want to be attached to any schedule, to keep blogging from becoming a chore. I may not post for many months or even a year. This doesn't mean I will eventually stop posting. I don't plan on giving up blogging any time soon.
