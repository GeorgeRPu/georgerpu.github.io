I am thrilled to announce that I have been promoted to Software Development Engineer II (SDE II) at Amazon! I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my colleagues, mentors, and managers who have supported me throughout my journey. Their guidance, feedback, and work is as responsible for any success as my own efforts.
